The point of this game is to allow users Protomega and Wondlerland to work on a simple project together.

The first objective is to create a map that a dog (*) will move around in.
The second is to give him treats to pick up (Using AI)
The third objective is to insert a second dog into the mix

This is a personal project for both YourWonderland and Protomega.

Please do not interfere. Thank you. :)
